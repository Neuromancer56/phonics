Phonics by gbacon24 and Neuromancer
The purpose of this mod is to teach people to read.   Initially it will be used to teach English, but there is no reason it could not be adapted to any language that relates symbols to sounds.   The idea is that there are 45 or so basic sounds in English, and only 26 characters to represent them,  so we will improvise and invent some new characters so that we have one per sound.   For example "oo", "sh", "ch", "ar", "au" and long vowel symbols.   By having 1 character represent 1 sound, you have simplified the language and given a beginner an easier way to start to learn how to read.   Reading words then becomes an exercise in sounding out words.

Current Functionality:
--For now you can left click the blue blocks and they make phonics sounds and light up. 
--Start by placing the blue phonics blocks and left clicking on them to hear their sounds.  They also light up.
--Next place a "sound out word" block (the one with a mouth on it) and then build a word by placing the blue blocks next to it.
--Left Click (punch) the mouth block to hear the word you built sounded out.
--more advanced readers can use the gray silent letters to have more accurate word spelling
This mod has a long way to go, but for now there is still plenty to do.  If you are teaching someone to read, have them try the following games:
-guess the sound each phonic makes until they know them all.  
-Give them word endings like "ot", "at", or "ing" and have them come up will as many words as they can by placing blocks in front of the endings.  (let them use the mouth block so they can hear the word sounded out).
-give them words to spell.
-spell out a word for them and have them read it to you.  If they get stuck, let them sound it out with the mouth block.
Plan for enhancements (being worked on):
--Left Clicking (punching) on the mouth block left click says a word it wants you to spell 
--followed by sounding out what you have spelled to the right of it.
--if what you have spelled matches one of the spellings for the mouth the block is looking for it makes a
---firework sound (eventually launching blocks into the air as fireworks)
--if you have not spelled the word the mouth block is looking for, it makes a sad noise.
--if you destroy mouth block, it destroys all letters to the right of it  (explode or fire burn)
--gray blocks are silent letters which are not sounded out 
-- this means we have to create sounds for words and an array of spellings for each word.
--if you don't want a word and want a new word, just destroy the mouth block.
--maybe have it spell out the correct answer if you put a show answer block on top of the mouth block.
--if you place a word block, a word is automatically generated to the right of the word block and you are expected to read it.
--you can click individual blocks to help you sound it out
--you can also left click the word block to get the answer (it will sound out the word and then say the word.)
--Create blocks with pictures of the thing that the word describes so that someone learning the language as a second language could also benefit.
--have a block give a word ending like "ing" and have the user create as many words as they can by adding a letter in front of that ending.
--someday have an NPC Tutor.
